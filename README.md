What is working on your project so far?

I am still figuring out how to go about my project. I started off late and need to go over the steps for it.

What are the current issues with your project?

My current issue is figuring out what to create for my project and how to put it in github.


Are there any additional features that you added to your app(optional,not mandatory)

I have not added any feature yet , I signed into github and thats it.

I have not done any script files yet, I am going to sumbit my scripts for the next assignments.
